# test_pages_admin.py

# Since pages/admin.py does not contain any custom admin model registrations or logic,
# there are no specific tests to write for this file. However, if custom admin functionality
# is added, tests should be created accordingly.

# For now, this file is intentionally left blank as there is nothing to test.
